# Retail_store
This SQL case study covers a variety of business analysis queries, including customer 
insights, product sales, revenue, order status, and payment methods. The queries leverage 
basic SQL concepts like JOIN, GROUP BY, aggregate functions (SUM(), AVG()), and filtering 
with WHERE. The goal is to help analyse the store's performance, customer purchasing 
behaviour, and sales trends. 
Each query is designed to answer a specific business question and can be adapted to meet 
additional reporting needs.
